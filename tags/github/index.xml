      <description>As a member of the community that like to generate npm packages like libraries and cli tools, sometimes is difficult to maintain everything and keep your package up to date in the dependencies side. I am a fan of having static dependencies as versioning is not being held correctly in most of the npm world. So if you dont use exact packages you could run in the issue that a broken change makes from the night to the morning your awesome tool to break.</description>

      <description>I have just finished migrating my static blog from Hexo to Hugo and one of the main things I care about is to be able to do continuous deployment of my profile and blog. There are quite a few blog posts out there but they are based on using shell scripts and it really becomes a pain to give permissions etc. In the next few lines you will see the simplest way I have found to do this (and is currently as this blog post is being published).</description>
